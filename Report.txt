task distribution 
We took a divide and conquer approach to complete this assignment. To manage all our code we utilised Github. 
Nina was in charge of step 1 - preprocessing. 
Anna was in charge of step 2 - Indexing 
Eve was in charge of step 3 - Retrieval and Ranking. 
Since each subsequent step required input of the previous step each of us tried to work fast and we explained our code and answered each others question. 
After the basic retrieval system was completed Eve then looked into optimisation and the results file while Anna and Nina worked on evaluation and the report.
